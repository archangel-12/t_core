- July 15-16th = These two days were marked by errors and progress because when I created separate folders for the client and backend, the browser console threw CORS errors, which led me to consider bringing Next.js back as the sole framework and copying the code over

After yesterday's CORS tragedy, I'm putting the UI and backend in one folder to avoid those pesky ``No Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header errors.
