- July 14th [10:32 GMT+7] = UI is visually done (blurred cards, sidebar, questions look clickable), Static "chat title" placeholders are in place, The input at the bottom is styled and visible, Routes seem to be laid out (/dashboard), Gemini integration was attempted (but had issues) but _No_ dynamic data flow or chat history persistence yet.
- July 15-16th = These two days were marked by errors and progress because when I created separate folders for the client and backend, the browser console threw CORS errors, which led me to consider bringing Next.js back as the sole framework and copying the code over
- July 17th [13:29 GMT+7] = Code copy is done, revisions are complete, and UI visuals are finalized. After yesterday's CORS tragedy, I'm putting the UI and backend in one folder to avoid those pesky ``No Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` header errors.
